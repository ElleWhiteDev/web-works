    - What is HTTP?
    
    Hyper Text Transfer Protocol is governs how clients get data from, or send data to, a server.
    
- What is a URL?
    
    Short for Uniform Resource Locator, a URL is an address for some internet resource.
    
- What is DNS?
    
    Short for Domain Name System, this is a system that takes human-readable URLs and converts them into IP addresses.
    
- What is a query string?
    
    The query string allows you to pass key-value pairs into the URL
    
- List two HTTP Verbs and their use cases.
    - GET - get some data from the server
    - POST - send some data to the server 
- What is an HTTP request?
    
    An HTTP request is a request from a client to a server which follows the HTTP protocol
    
- What is an HTTP response?
    
    An HTTP response is a response from a server to a client which follows the HTTP protocol (eg sending back HTML/CSS/JS/etc)
    
- What is an HTTP header? Give a couple examples of request and response headers you have seen.
    - Headers provide additional information about the request or the response. Here are some examples:
    - Request headers: Host, User-Agent, Accept, Cookie, Cache-Control

- What happens when you type a URL in a browser?
    1. Your browser “resolves” the name into an IP address using DNS
    2. Your browser makes a request to that IP address, including headers
    3. The server sends a response 
    4. The browser makes a DOM from that HTML, and finds any other resources needed 
    5. The browser makes separate HTTP requests for those resources and receives response from the server for each
